# Keras Tensorflow Neural Network Recognition API

This repository contains the source code for neural networks with transcribing capabilities in a Django API. The API is described with Swagger OpenAPI 3.0. See deployment below on how to open the swagger documentation page. </br></br>

The goal for this project was to learn about the math involved with neural network and how to construct the layers in a neural network. This learning goal was part of my data science minor, where I build a handwriting recognition neural network based on a research paper from Graves A. & Schmidhuber J. called <a href='https://people.idsia.ch/~juergen/nips2009.pdf' target='_blank'>Offline Handwriting Recognition with Multidimensional Recurrent Neural Networks</a>
